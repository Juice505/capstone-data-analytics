Final Capstone Project for Data Analytics Course
Violent Crime Analysis in Maricopa County (2017-2025) Specifically the Phoenix Police Department
Author: Tyler Arias

Overview
This project analyzes violent crime trends in Phoenix, Arizona using public arrest data from the Arizona Department of Public Safety (AZDPS). The analysis explores demographic patterns, gender differences and time-based crime trends. The project also uses predictive modeling, to forecast crime rates up to 2030 and multiple statistical and machine learning techniques. The purpose of this project is to understand historical crime patterns, evaluate demographi disparities, and provide actionable insights for public policy.
